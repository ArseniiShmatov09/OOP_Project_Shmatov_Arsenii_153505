During the development of the application for time management, the following goals were achieved:
A software tool based on an object–oriented programming paradigm was developed, which allows you to effectively manage tasks and projects.
OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, SOLID principles (Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle) are applied, which provides flexibility, code reuse and ease of project support.
Programming patterns such as MVVM (Model– View– ViewModel) and Singleton are used to separate logic and representation, as well as to guarantee the existence of only one instance of the Controller class.
Further prospects for modification and development of the project:
Integration with other platforms: Development of versions of the application for various operating systems (Android, iOS) and integration with popular platforms and services for task management (for example, Google Tasks, Trello). This will expand the user base and improve the availability of the application.
 Improving the user interface: Further improving the design and interactivity of the user interface to improve the usability of the application and attract more users.
Application Usage examples:
Personal Task Management: The application can be used to plan and organize personal affairs and tasks. The user will be able to create a list of tasks, set deadlines, assign priorities and track progress.
Project Management in a team: The application can be a useful tool for teamwork on projects. Team members can create and assign tasks, track progress status, and share information within the application.
Academic Goals and Academic Projects: Students and researchers can use the app to plan and manage their academic assignments, projects and deadlines. This will help them to organize their time effectively and achieve their goals.
The developed time management software is a useful tool for organizing and managing tasks and projects. Further development and improvement of the project will expand its functionality, attract more users and increase their productivity in time and task management.
